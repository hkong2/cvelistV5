This issue, categorized under CWE-1321, arises from improper validation of user-supplied input in the package's resource initialization process. Successful exploitation may lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution in affected environments. The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 5.0.0-beta.19, and no official fix has been released to date."
