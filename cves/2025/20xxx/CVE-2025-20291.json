Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.\r\n\r This vulnerability existed because of insufficient validation of URLs that were included in a meeting-join URL. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by including a URL to a website of their choosing in a specific value of a Cisco Webex Meetings join URL. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to redirect a targeted user to a website that was controlled by the attacker, possibly making the user more likely to believe the website was trusted by Webex and perform additional actions as part of phishing attacks."
