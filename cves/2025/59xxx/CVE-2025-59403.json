It is responsible for the camera feed on Falcon, Sparrow, and Bravo devices, but exposes administrative API endpoints on port 8080 without authentication. Endpoints include but are not limited to: /reboot, /logs, /crashpack, and /adb/enable. This results in multiple impacts including denial of service (DoS) via /reboot, information disclosure via /logs, and remote code execution (RCE) via /adb/enable. The latter specifically results in adb being started over TCP without debugging confirmation, providing an attacker in the LAN/WLAN with shell access."
